#### Bio

<b>Heydar Soudani</b> is a first-year Ph.D. student of information retrieval at the Institute of Computing and Information Sciences (iCIS) at Radboud University, under the joint supervision of Faegheh Hasibi and Evangelos Kanoulas. He holds a Bachelor's degree from Polytechnic of Tehran and a Master's degree from Sharif University of Technology. His research revolves around conversational systems in low-resource domains and languages. Recently, his work has primarily concentrated on the development of models aimed at generating new synthetic multi-turn conversation data.

<b>Faegheh Hasibi</b> is an assistant professor of information retrieval at the Institute of Computing and Information Sciences (iCIS) at Radboud University. Her research is situated at the intersection of Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing, with a particular emphasis on conversational AI and semantic search systems. She explores various aspects, including knowledge-grounded conversational search, entity linking and retrieval, and the utilization of knowledge graphs for semantic search tasks. Her contributions to the field are evident through her numerous publications in renowned international conferences such as SIGIR, CIKM, COLING, and ICTIR. Moreover, she has actively served as the general chair of different conferences and sessions, including ICTIR 2021 and the Netherlands ICT with Industry 2023. Her expertise and insights have also led her to be invited to deliver talks on topics such as "Entity Linking in Documents and Conversations" and "Smarter Search with Knowledge Graphs: Entity Retrieval and Linking."

<b>Evangelos Kanoulas</b> is a Full Professor at the Faculty of Science of the Informatics Institute at the University of Amsterdam. He has been the co-organizer CLEF eHealth Lab and of the Technologically Assisted Reviews in Empirical Medicine task. Driven by the goal of enhancing human-machine interaction, his research explores effective conversational approaches that enable machines to better understand users' needs and provide relevant responses. His work is particularly valuable in challenging domains such as legal and medical search, where achieving high recall is crucial. With numerous publications in prestigious international conferences including ECIR, SIGIR, CIKM, SIGKDD, and WWW, he has made significant contributions to the field. He has also organized several workshops, with the most recent one being the Augmented Intelligence in Technology-Assisted Review Systems, held in ECIR2023.
