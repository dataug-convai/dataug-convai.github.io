## Abstract
Advancements in conversational systems have revolutionized information access, surpassing the limitations of single queries. 
However, developing dialogue systems requires a large amount of training data, which is a challenge in low-resource domains and languages. Traditional data collection methods like crowd-sourcing are labor-intensive and time-consuming, making them ineffective in this context. Data augmentation (DA) is an affective approach to alleviate the data scarcity problem in conversational systems. This tutorial provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of DA approaches in the context of conversational systems. It highlights recent advances in conversation augmentation, open domain and task-oriented conversation generation, and different paradigms of evaluating these models. We also discuss current challenges and future directions in order to help researchers and practitioners to further advance the field in this area.


## Target Audience and Prerequisites
This tutorial is designed for professionals, students, and researchers in information retrieval and natural language processing, specifically interested in conversational AI.
Familiarity with machine learning, deep learning and transformers is required. No prior knowledge of dialogue system models or data augmentation methods is necessary.
