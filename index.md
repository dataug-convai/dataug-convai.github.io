Welcome! This is the page of our tutorial "<b>Data Augmentation for Conversational AI</b>" at the ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) 2023.

Hi

## Abstract
In the era of information technology, the conventional method of acquiring desired information through a single query has become insufficient. Advancements in neural networks and deep learning have led to the emergence of conversational systems as more effective means of accessing information. However, training high-parameter conversational models presents a significant challenge due to the reliance on large amounts of data, especially in low-resource domains and languages.
The traditional method of data collection, crowd-sourcing, is labor-intensive and time-consuming, making it ineffective in this context. This tutorial aims to address the issue of data shortage in the field of dialogue systems by providing a comprehensive review of data augmentation and generation methods. It explores the utilization of existing dialogue data, as well as external resources such as unstructured text files, knowledge graphs, and information embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs), to generate new conversation data.
Moreover, the tutorial investigates dialogue system models that show potential for generating new data, even if they were not originally designed for that purpose. The tutorial systematically categorizes and summarizes the current works in three main sections: Conversation Augmentation, Open Domain Conversation Generation, and Task-oriented Conversation Generation. This categorization offers a comprehensive overview of the field and provides insights into various approaches.
Furthermore, the tutorial highlights future directions and addresses open questions in the field. It discusses existing evaluation metrics and datasets, shedding light on the assessment of system performance. Additionally, the tutorial emphasizes the need for more realistic and challenging conversation scenarios to improve the capabilities of conversational systems.


## Targeted Audience
This tutorial is designed for professionals, students, and researchers in information retrieval and natural language processing, specifically interested in conversational AI.
No prior knowledge of dialogue system models or data augmentation methods is necessary.
Our content caters to several beneficiary groups: researchers and practitioners exploring data augmentation and generation techniques for conversational systems, those addressing data scarcity in specific domains and languages, and developers of efficient dialogue systems modeling real-world situations.
